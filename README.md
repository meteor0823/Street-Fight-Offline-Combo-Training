# Street-Fight-Offline-Combo-Training

我十分热衷于《街头霸王 6》这款游戏。然而，这款游戏需要大量的连招训练来提升水平。可日常生活中，我却很少能腾出时间开启游戏进行连招练习。鉴于此，我萌生了编写一款轻量化的连招训练程序的想法，目前该项目刚刚启动。现在面临的关键问题在于，如何获取标准的连招输入流程，以及怎样精准判断我的输入是否正确。

I am really into the game of Street Fighter 6. But this game demands a great deal of combo training to improve. However, in my daily life, I seldom have the chance to open the game for combo practice. In light of this, I came up with the idea of creating a lightweight combo training program, which has just been initiated. The crucial problems now are how to obtain the standard combo input process and how to accurately determine whether my input is correct.
